# Interstellar Journey Time Calculator

This program calculates the time it takes for a spaceship to travel to a distant places in Universe from two different perspectives: an observer at the departure point and a traveler on the spaceship. The calculations are based on the Lorentz factor*, a concept from Einstein's theory of special relativity.

## How It Works

The program first prompts the user to input the name of the destination star, the departure point, and a name of the spaceship. It then asks for the distance to the star in light years and the speed of the spaceship as a fraction of the speed of light.

Using these inputs, it calculates:
- The Lorentz factor
- The time it would take from an Earth observer's perspective
- The time it would take from a spaceship traveler's perspective
- The number of human generations that would live and die on Earth during this journey

The program then prints these results.

## Usage

Compile and run the program. When prompted, enter the required information. The program will then display the results.

## Example

Here's an example of what you might see when you run the program:

```
Please enter the name of your destination point: Alpha Centauri
Please enter your current location (departure point): Earth
Please enter the name of your spaceship: Starship
Please enter the distance from your departure point to your destination star in light years: 4.367
Please enter the speed of your spaceship as a fraction of the speed of light (0 < speed < 1): 0.5

From an observer's perspective on Earth, it will take approximately 8.73 years for Starship to reach Alpha Centauri.
However, due to the effects of special relativity, a traveler on Starship will feel as though 7.66 years have passed.
This means that all passengers on Starship will age by approximately 7.66 years during this journey.
Meanwhile, their friends and family back on Earth will age by approximately 8.73 years.
During this journey, approximately 0.12 generations of humans would live and die back on Earth.
```

*Lorentz factor is a quantity that expresses how much the measurements of time, length, and other physical properties change for an object moving at a high speed. It appears in several equations of special relativity and arises from deriving the Lorentz transformations. It is named after its early appearance in Lorentzian electrodynamics - named after the Dutch physicist Hendrik Lorentz.
Lorentz factor is usually denoted by γ (the lowercase Greek letter gamma). Sometimes (especially when discussing superluminal motion) the factor is written as Γ (the uppercase Greek letter gamma) instead of γ.
Lorentz factor is defined as
gamma=frac1sqrt1−fracv2c2
where:

v is the relative velocity between inertial frames of reference,
c is the speed of light in vacuum,
β is the ratio of v to c,
t is coordinate time,
τ is proper time for an observer (the measurement of time intervals in the observer’s own frame of reference).
